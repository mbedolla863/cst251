	<h1>Lab 15</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>For this lab, I faced no challenges. I knew what codes Wes was asking for and just simply applied them.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I attemped to put a box shadow around the gifs but they came out to be long lines under the picture so it didnt work out.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The effects that we learned are really cool! I put a rounded border and added a text shadow to make it pop. I will most likely use all these effects in the next labs to come.</p>
