	<title>Lab X - Subject/Topic</title>
<h1>Lab 4</h1>
</head>
<h2>Subject: File Transfer</h2>
<p>This subject is on file transfer. This is where we grab whatever we did on Atom with correct coding, and make it go public on GitHub.</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>Honestly, I had no problem with this lab. It was pretty straight forward and almost the same as lab 3</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>It came out to be a success. I feel way better publishing the website because I had help with it in class from Mr.Wes. I am very happy that I can look it up knowing I did the work to create it.</p>
