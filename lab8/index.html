  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>The challenges I faced when creating this lab, was the how to use the selectors as examples. As in how to show that I can do what Mr. Wes is asking for.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p class="skate">Again, the only problems was just trying to solve through which I can portray that I used the CSS code selectors. You CAN'T just plug in these codes and expect them to just work without formatting them right.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p> After figuring out how to put things into practice, it came out to be another success. This webpage is a bit flashy but it made learn how to use selectors so i'm not disappointed that I learned what I needed to learn out of this lab.</p>
