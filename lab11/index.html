    <p>Facts about me. First off, I was born and raised from Stockton, CA. Between 2 1/2 to 3 hours away from Moneterey Bay. During the quarantine, I went and got my motorcycle license and bought my first bike. Lastly, I have a huge sweettooth. I love sugarary sweet tastes like ice cream, chocolate, cinnamon etc. If I could ice cream everyday I would (while maintaining good health of course).</p>
