    <h1>Lab 7</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
     <p>The only challenges that I had was just constantly looking up CSS features. As in what codes do what to my browser page.</p>
     <h2>Problems</h2>
     <p>The only problem I have is the spacing between the heading and paragraph. I want to close the gap more but it is not apart of the assignment but just for my sake.</p>
     <h2>Results</h2>
     <p>Ultimately, this lab was really cool. I found myself really wanting to do so much more to this page than asked for. Just to explore more features to make it stand out from others.</p>
