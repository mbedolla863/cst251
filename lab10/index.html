  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>Another day, another lab. So, this lab was not super tuff either. Just select a font and paste it. Also make sure it looks nice and readable.</p>

 <div id="second">
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>the only problem was making the borders match up to the picture. Even thought that was not part of the lab subject, that was the only problem I encountered this lab. </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I am happy with the fonts that make this website look cool. It fits the theme and it is clear to read too. That was something I was worried about, that it wouldn't be readable.</p>
