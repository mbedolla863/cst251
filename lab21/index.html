  <h1>Lab 20</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
     <p>So for this lab I had challenges taking my old skecth ideas and changing them due to our team main points.</p>
     <h2>Problems</h2>
     <p>the issue that made this challenging was that we all agreed is to do a gallery type website so I had to grab my old drawings and switch them to the gallery style.</p>
     <h2>Results</h2>
     <p>Once I started getting the ideas on to the paper, it flowed naturally and came out to be some pretty swell ideas. Hopefully the team likes them.</p>
     <h2>Peers Feedback</h2>
     <p>They actaully liked my drawings. They saw the detail in them right away. Especially for being done in such a short time. It was great feedback and nothing to harsh.</p>
