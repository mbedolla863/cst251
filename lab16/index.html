		<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>For some reason atom was giving me such a hard time. It always keeps asking for suggestions whenever I typed anything. The css codes were way different than I learned in class and in w3schools. I finally got everything working but it just took alot of deleting and replacing. it was nothing like I learned in class.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I had a lot of problems for some reason with this lab. As if atom was not responding the way it used to be. It was really frustrating to figure out why my notes and pictures for class was just not working. I even had other peers help me and my work was so differenmt than theirs.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p> I really have no lcue why this was harder than usual. Especially for an easy lab like this. Regardless, it came out well and got the job done.</p>
