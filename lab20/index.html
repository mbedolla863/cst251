  <h1>Lab 20</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
     <p>For this lab, we had to draw up a bunch of sketches for our project webpage which was the challenge for me. I am very picky in details so it was a bit difficult to not redo something or leave things the way they were.</p>
     <h2>Problems</h2>
     <p>The problems came about because I would not be quick during the drawing process. I would spend way to much time on some without knowing. Plus, another hardship i faced was trying to come up with new sketches that were different than before. I feel like you can only design a website a few ways with the skills that we have.</p>
     <h2>Results</h2>
     <p>I got the sketches done but not real happy of the work. Luckily, this is just the first step and prototyping. Yet, it still bothers me but I got it done.</p>
