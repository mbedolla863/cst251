  <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>This one was way easier to figure out than the last lab. Only challenges we faced was the constant positioning of things.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>As said before, the positioning was the problem. Just constantly checking back and forth and changing the pixels to get everything perfectly in lined to one another.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>It came to be super close as the original website. Just changed the the emails is the biggest differnce you can spot. Nevertheless, everything is in place where it needs to be.</p>
