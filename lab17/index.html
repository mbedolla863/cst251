    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p>This lab was not that bad when trying it out. There were a little bumps here and there of positioning and sizing of the boxes in flexbox. But solved it eventually.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>The problem was how are we going to get what we drew up make it appear on the website. Float was pretty simple but the flexbox was new so it took some time trying to figure it out. In the end, we got everything position well.</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>Instead of putting "float" or "clear", we could just simply delete them off the css in the flexbox. Evertyhing was already in boxes ready to be moved around and it wasn't to bad. Still a little ruff around the edges but we got lab 17 up and running.</p>
